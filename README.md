# SpeechAssistant
Goals for this project: 
* Develop a fully functionaly personal assistant that can understand commands in English 
* Demonstrate my ability to incorporate several different APIs and system functionality 
* Further my interest in bots and "A.I" 

For a more in-depth explanation why I made this, go to documentation.md. 

<h1> Features </h1>
<hr>
* Robot that listens to your command and performs a certain function, such as getting the current weather

<h1> Need to install to run </h1>
<hr>
1. speech_recognition (sphnix), pocketsphnix, pyowm
However I set things up in a virtual environement this time, therefore you just need to activiate it and it should work.
$source venv/bin/activate
